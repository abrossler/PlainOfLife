## Development server

Run `npm run start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

For debugging with Visual Studio Code set a breakpoint and run configuration `Launch Chrome against localhost`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` or `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` or `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

For debugging with Visual Studio Code set a breakpoint and run configuration `Attach Karma Chrome for debugging`. Then refresh Karma in browser...

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
